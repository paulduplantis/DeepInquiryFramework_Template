# DeepInquiryFramework_Template
This is the main repository for the Deep Inquiry Framework Pilot Template

What exactly is a Deep Inquiry Framework? 

It is a free and open source framework to build web applications to allow for the deep discovery and sharing of information without using traditional tactics to influence users found on websites and applications currently. The focus of the framework is to provide a foundation for collaboration across the free and open source community to build solutions across the web to encourage quality engagement between creators and curators of experiences and consumers of it. 

The Deep Inquiry Framework is a concept to be covered in the last chapter of my book titled The Emergence: We Have a Communication Problem. I will shop this book for publishing once I have the Pilot Framework live. 

I have decided to build two DIFs, one as a for profit, the other as a non profit to serve as templates for others to build off of. 

The first DIF focuses on displaying SaaS Software and related affiliate links against content I have curated from the web as well as relevant content I have created for the end consumer.  These consumers are small to midsize business decision makers who are in the market for software to help increase operational efficiency, marketing, and sales for their organization. 

The second DIF will focus on a non profit I am creating that will focus on Mental Health Awareness called Pathways for Mental Health. I am creating this DIF as a pilot site for a community who may interested at looking how a DIF could potentially align their resources with those in need. 

All of the code for this first DIFs will be available to copy and revise and use at will at this Github repository. There is a link on the footer of all pages with the DIF logo. By keeping this link on the site means the following principles are agreed to:

Built on FOSS (Free and Open Software) Principles
No Logins required other than for private exchanges
No behavioral tracking
No cookies stored in client devices 
No popups 
No third party ad networks
No third party platform integration
Advanced filtering used to provide user agency over content
Advanced sharing built as a feature

Any DIF site built in the future, not adhering to these principles, will have the link deactivated.

What is the benefit of carrying a DIF link on a site? Not much other than a declaration that you are following the principles to fight for a more open web that is not in the business of mining attention for profit. It will not affect you being able to engage with the GitHub repository or to use future code though. 

I am not a Code and using ChatGPT and Claude 3 to help be build the framework so I would appreciate any feedback on the code. I would love this to turn into a collaborative project where the code collectively built here spurs new development to follow the principles outlined above.
